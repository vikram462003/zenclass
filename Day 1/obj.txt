JavaScript Objects:

1.In JavaScript, objects are defined using the object literal syntax, which involves enclosing a set of property-value pairs in curly braces.
2.Each property of an object is a key-value pair, where the key is a string and the value can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, booleans, and other objects.
3.objects are dynamically typed, which means that their properties can be added, removed, or modified at runtime.

Internal Representation of JavaScript Objects:

1.When an object is created in JavaScript, it is stored in memory as a reference. This means that when you assign an object to a variable, you're not actually copying the object itself into the variable, but rather a reference to the object.
2.objects are passed by reference. This means that when an object is passed as an argument to a function, the function receives a reference to the same object.
